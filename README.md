# Neovim and Plugin Setup Script

This script automates the installation and configuration of Neovim along with various plugins for a seamless development environment. It detects the operating system (macOS or Linux) and installs Neovim and necessary dependencies accordingly.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed on macOS or the appropriate package manager for your Linux distribution (APT in this script).

## Usage

1. Open a terminal.

2. Save the script to a file, for example, `neovim_setup.sh`.

3. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x neovim_setup.sh
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./neovim_setup.sh
   ```

The script will perform the following actions:

- Detect the operating system (macOS or Linux).
- Install Neovim and create a basic configuration file.
- Set up a plugin manager (vim-plug) for managing Neovim plugins.
- Install and configure the following plugins:
  - YouCompleteMe
  - coc.nvim
  - Lightline
  - Gruvbox Color Scheme
  - Autopairs
- Enable line numbers and syntax highlighting in the Neovim configuration.
- Set up additional configurations for the plugins.
- Install dependencies for YouCompleteMe and coc.nvim.
- Install and configure Language Server Protocol (LSP) for specific languages (e.g., Python).

## Notes

- Customize the script to adapt to your specific requirements, including adjusting LSP configurations for different languages.
- The script does not run with `sudo` and should be executed as a regular user.
- You may be prompted to enter your GitHub credentials or a personal access token during the script's execution if your repository requires authentication.
